# Simple tic tac toe game for demonstrating c23 capabilities
## Installation
tictac uses [xmake](https://xmake.io/) to build
the executable and the library.
Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone github.com/cesarcarlosteixeira/tictac
```
cd and xmake install:
```shell
cd tictac && xmake install
```
this will bring the *tic* command and the
dynamic library *tictac* to the appropriate 
local; which can be used in futher projects.
